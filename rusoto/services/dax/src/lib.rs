//! <p>DAX is a managed caching service engineered for Amazon DynamoDB. DAX dramatically speeds up database reads by caching frequently-accessed data from DynamoDB, so applications can access that data with sub-millisecond latency. You can create a DAX cluster easily, using the AWS Management Console. With a few simple modifications to your code, your application can begin taking advantage of the DAX cluster and realize significant improvements in read performance.</p>
//!
//! If you're using the service, you're probably looking for [DynamodbAcceleratorClient](struct.DynamodbAcceleratorClient.html) and [DynamodbAccelerator](trait.DynamodbAccelerator.html).
